3d-chess
========

Description
-----------

A C++ implementation of 3D chess. Not the Star Trek kind; not the standard-chess-with-pretty-graphics kind; this is a full 8 x 8 x 8 chessboard (chesscube?). With 13 types of pieces (including the traditional 6), a whopping 64 pawns per side, and an additional dimension to navigate, this will be... interesting?

It's not complete yet. For example, I need to write an AI opponent, and make actual models for each piece. Right now, it's just a bunch of colored pyramids. I've asked a friend of mine who actually knows how to use Blender to help out, so that'll happen eventually.

Installation
------------

This project uses OpenGL and wxWidgets. I'm not entirely sure how to correctly distribute these dependencies. So until I figure that out, you're on your own.

The piece names and initial board setup come from hixoxih.com. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, this site is no longer accessible.
