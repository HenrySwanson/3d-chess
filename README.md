3d-chess
========

A C++ implementation of 3D chess. Not the Star Trek kind; this is a full 8 x 8 x 8 chessboard (chesscube?).

For quite some time, I've wanted to make some 3D expansion of chess. Unfortunately, I couldn't find much on the Internet. Or at least, not the sort of thing I was thinking of. I did manage to find one site (hixoxih.com), but it's inaccessible now. Most of the rules and pieces are from there.

During a summer camp (EPGY) in 2010, I wrote a Java implementation of the game. Turns out I knew absolutely nothing back then, so that code is never again going to see the light of day. This is a total re-write and re-design.

When complete, this will have an AI opponent (playing against yourself is boring), actual 3D graphics (before, it was 8 separate windows, one for each "slice" of the board), and no improper use of threads (I'd rather not explain that one...).
